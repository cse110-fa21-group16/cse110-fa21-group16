For all recipes, follow the Base Steps then move onto the recipe specific steps. Click\u00a0here\u00a0for a PDF printable version of all these recipes on one page.Use the recipe slider to change the serving size. Key step (especially for simple pastas like these) - tossing the sauce with the cooked pasta and a splash of pasta cooking water. The fat in the sauce reacts with the starch in the cooking water, thickening the sauce and making it stick to the pasta strands. This is the proper way to make pasta - no self respecting Italian or restaurant would ever skip this step!",
